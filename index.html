  <b> Brief Summary of Tesla's Life:</b>    
    <u1><br />
      -Nikola Tesla was born on July 10, 1856, as the fourth child of a family living in Smijan, Croatia.<br />
      -Nikola Tesla had a hard time communicating with people and had an introverted childhood.<br />
      -He experienced the first tragedy in his life with the death of his older brother. It wasn't just his brother's death that negatively affected Tesla. His older brother died from a fall from a horse, and his family always blamed Tesla for scaring the horse.<br />
      -Compared to his talents, intelligence and skills, the education he received at school was not enough for Tesla after a while. In addition to this, he had to leave his university education in 1878, when he was in the 3rd grade, when the social communication problems he had with people were added.<br />
      -It aimed for people to use electricity in a much easier and cheaper way. At that time, electricity was supplied to the houses with  direct current, but Tesla thought that the distribution of electricity with alternating current was much  more economical in terms of cost. He went to New York to achieve this goal.<br />
      -He began to receive patents for his inventions, and the number of these patents exceeded 30.<br />
      -Edison offered Tesla a job to develop DC motors, and he promised to pay him $50,000 for it. Tesla did dozens of different studies on the project and eventually developed a method and presented it to Edison. However, Edison did not pay Tesla the 50 thousand dollars he had committed. At the end of 6 months, he ended his collaboration with Edison.<br />
      -Dedicating his talents, inventions and his entire life to humanity, Tesla failed in many attempts because of people who left him alone. This situation did not lessen her will, desire and hard work to realize her dreams. He started from the beginning every time, continued to produce projects and to do useful works for humanity.<br />
